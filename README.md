# rori_desktop_endpoint

This is a simple endpoint for _[RORI](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/)_. Just a simple application to execute shell and music commands from `rori_server` on a linux computer.

# Installation

This application requires _Rust language_ (please read this [page](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)) and _openssl_. To build the software, you just have to launch `cargo build` in this repository. You will need _Python 3_ and _rhythmbox_ for the music script (or you will need to rewrite _scripts/music.py_)

# Configuration

## Connect to rori_server

Note: you need to configure a `rori_server` first.

### Entry point side

You can configure the connection from _config_server.json_:

```json
"rori_ip":"ip of rori_server",
"rori_port":"port of rori_server",
"name":"the name you want",
"secret":"the secret you want",
```

### rori_server side

You need to authorize the entrypoint to communicate with `rori_server`. In _config_server.json_ you need to add:

```json
"authorize": [
  {
    "name":"the name you choose",
    "secret":"sha256 of the secret you choose"
  }
]
```

## Authorize rori_server

You need to authorize `rori_server` to communicate with you. In _config_server.json_ you must add:

```json
"authorize": [
  {
    "name":"the name of the rori_server",
    "secret":"sha256 of the secret of the rori_server"
  }
]
```

## Tls configuration

All connections need to be secured. So you need to generate a private key and a certificate. On linux, you can run this following command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`. It will create a certificate (_cert.pem_) and a private key (_key.pem_). Now, you can add these files to _config_server.json_.

## Final

The final _config_server.json_ should look like this:

```json
{
 "ip":"0.0.0.0",
 "port":"1414",
 "rori_ip":"127.0.0.1",
 "rori_port":"1412",
 "owner":"AmarOk",
 "name":"rori_desktop_client",
 "compatible_types":"music|shell",
 "cert":"key/cert.pem",
 "key":"key/key.pem",
 "secret":"secret",
 "authorize": [
   {
     "name":"rori_server",
     "secret":"2BB80D537B1DA3E38BD30361AA855686BDE0EACD7162FEF6A25FE97BF527A25B"
   }
 ]
}
```

# Command execution

## shell commands

When this endpoint receives a RORIData from `rori_server` with _datatype = shell_ it executes `sh -c "RORIData.content"`. If you want to know what shell commands you can receive, you just have to configure modules of your `rori_server`.

## music commands

When this endpoint receives a RORIData from `rori_server` with _datatype = music_ it executes `python3 scripts/music.py "RORIData.content"`. For now, the script is pretty basic:

```python
import sys
import subprocess

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    if sys.argv[1] == "start":
        print("start music")
        subprocess.Popen("rhythmbox \"`find ~/Music/*.mp3 -type f | shuf -n 1`\"&", shell=True)
    if sys.argv[1] == "stop":
        print("stop music")
        subprocess.Popen("pkill rhythmbox", shell=True)
```

So, you can rewrite this script to execute what you want.

# Execution

A binary is present in the _target/_ directory after a `cargo build` or you can execute `cargo run` in your shell.
